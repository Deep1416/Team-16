<!-- Creating a clone of CodePen is a significant project that involves a front-end application, a back-end server to handle user authentication, saving pens, and potentially executing user code securely. Documenting such a project would be extensive, but I can provide you with a basic outline for a README file. You may need to expand on each section based on your specific implementation:
